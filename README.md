## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have a local web server with PHP and a MySQL database installed. We recommend using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) for easy setup.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahana-hosur/eduStack.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd eduStack
   ```
3. **Setup the Database**:
   - Import the `minor-project.sql` file into your MySQL database to create the necessary tables.
   - Configure your database connection settings in the PHP files (e.g., `php/config.php`).

4. **Start the Web Server**:
   - If using XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.
   - Place the project folder in the `htdocs` directory of XAMPP.

5. **Access the Platform**:
